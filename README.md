# Artspeak : creative coding platform

- At this point, it is basically a clone of [tixy.land](https://tixy.land/)

- In future, the idea to extend features and "try" to reach something like [shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/), but staying minimal at its core.

## How?

- [x] For desktop -> write a language from scratch and use raylib for graphics
- [ ] For web -> compile to html and wasm using emscripten

## Using artspeak

For now, I have locally tested only on my machine(linux)

Dependencies: [fmt](https://fmt.dev/), [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)

Then cmake into a build folder, hopefully it should work.
